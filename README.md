# EDGE DETECTION ALGORITHMS

### Problem statement
The project is used for detecting the edge of subjects in the
images manually with different method such as: Gradient op-
eration, Laplace operation, Laplace operation with Gaussian
and Canny method. These manual functions are then com-
pared with built-in functions from OpenCV library.

### Necessary libraries: 
NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and OpenCV.

### Technical skills: 
- Source code: Python
- Report: LaTex
